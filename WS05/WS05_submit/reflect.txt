The difference I see between functor and lambda expression is that functor can point different functions with different types, while lambda expression does a specific task within defined local area. Lambda syntax was very confusing. I still need some time to get used to it. But it can be very useful as it can be written concisely. It reminds me of Javascript arrow function. 
If I handle an error without exception, I need to make a more complex logic flow when an error occurs. And I have to write a longer customer message in many places. And it could be hard to read the flow by someone else seeing the code. 
I think I can optimize the code by adding parent class of Movie and Book. Separate common variables and functions like common queries, operators in the parent class. 
Default constructor is created implicitly by compiler even if I don’t write in the class. But it’s recommended to have it as well as initialize member variable to use safely.
